### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm extremely new to coding and the tech world. 
Currently, I am on maternity leave and have decided to learn a new skill or two and possibly a career change into the tech industry. 
I have been working in the funeral industry for the past 15 years.
I'm eager to learn and ready for a change.

I enjoy spending time  with my family (partner, our two sons Arlo (4 years) and Mylo (4.5 months) and my partners son); 
we enjoy going for hikes, watching movies and throwing rocks at the beach, as well all things toddler.
